# Nark Navigation

Nark Navigation is an open-source navigation companion for ZeppOS smartwatches.

It consists of two components:

- 📱 Android Companion App
- ⌚ ZeppOS Smartwatch App

The Android app listens for Google Maps navigation notifications, extracts turn-by-turn navigation data, and securely forwards it to the connected smartwatch over Bluetooth.

The goal is to let users navigate comfortably from their wrist without constantly checking their phone.

> ⚠️ **Status:** Active Development
>
> This project is functional but still under active development. You may encounter bugs, glitches, unfinished features, or unexpected behavior.

# Before Using

For reliable operation:

1. Grant **Notification Access**.
2. Set **Battery Usage** for Nark Navigation to **Unrestricted**.
3. Allow the app to run in the background.

> Android battery optimization may stop the background service, preventing navigation updates from reaching the watch.
